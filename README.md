# Project description
## Data Tracking:
Students can add, edit, and delete assignments in the four categories of classwork, homework, projects and assessments.

## Data Trends:
Using the student's assignment data and Chart.js, various graphs help students visual their data and understand the trends in their work and their progress.

## Goal Setting:
Students use data trends to create meaningful, data-based SMART goals that teachers can review. At the end of the goal, students can provide a reflection based on their final data.

## Teacher Dashboard:
Teachers can monitor student assignment data, goals, and provide meaningful feedback in a quick, easy to use dashboard.
